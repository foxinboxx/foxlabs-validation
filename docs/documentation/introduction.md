## Introduction
    
This validation framework does not implement the [JSR-303](http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr303/index.html)
specification. The main features of this implementation are:

- Ability to modify (correct) test values.
- Support for validation of localized values.
- Conversion of values into and from text representation.
- Formating of error messages, depending on the context.
- Support for metadata, which allows to check any entity types.
- Long list of predefined validation components.
- Good opportunities for expansion.

In chapters 3 and 4, you will find detailed information on all of the above features.
